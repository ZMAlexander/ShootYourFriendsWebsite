<h1>So you might be wondering who the heck are these guys even? </h1>

<p>
	Without getting too introspective, we're not too sure of that ourselves. 
	It's so early in the development cycle that we haven't had nailed down a business name or jumped through all the hoops to become an incorporated entity. 
	In fact, if you're reading this post when it was written, you're probably on one of our developers' personal GitHub pages right now.

	So if we can't tell you about the company - since it doesn't exist - we can at least tell you about our operations. 
	We're developing this game in Canada, in the east-coast province of New Brunswick. 
	Most of us met in college, became firm friends, and started playing video games together. 
	It wasn't long before we decided we ought to be building games too, seeing as how we have that skillset and all.
