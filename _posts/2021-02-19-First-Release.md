# Home Stretch
Hello friends! When last we met we shared that we had published our Steam store page. Well today we're excited to announce
<!--more-->
that Shoot Your Friends is now available for purchase through Steam!

So there it is, in print, and all official. We couldn't be more proud of what we've done, and I know we certainly couldn't have done it without each other. Seeing something we made actually available and ready to share with the world - well it gives us warm, fuzzy feelings, that's for sure.

You might be wondering what's next for us. Well, we like to keep busy and we've set our sights on another project. But that's still over the horizon and I think you'll forgive us if we want to take a well earned break for the moment. But that doesn't mean we're done work on Shoot Your Friends though. We still have a couple ideas rattling around that we'd like to see, so you can probably expect a content update at some point in the future.

Well, that's all we wanted to say today. Did you buy the game yet?
