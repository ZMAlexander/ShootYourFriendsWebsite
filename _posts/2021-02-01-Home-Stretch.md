# Home Stretch
Hello friends! This past week we finally did the thing and published our Steam store page!
<!--more-->
Now, due to Valve policy and release cycles and such, you can't actually buy the game yet. But if you've been following along, I know you'd like to get in there and wishlist the game so you'll be notified the very instant that you can Shoot Your Friends.

So where can you check out this fabulous store page? Right [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484970/Shoot_Your_Friends/) of course! Look at that link. It's so little, just four characters long, but it represents so many hopes and dreams of all of us here at Fancy Pigeon Studios.

Anywho, we're roughly three weeks out from release which means we're keeping busy crushing bugs and putting the final bits of polish into the game. We're super proud of what we've accomplished and can't wait to share it with you all!
