# May 8, 2020
Hey friends, welcome to the Shoot Your Friends development diary! 
<!--more-->
All too often we've been burned by video games where the developers do not make an effort to engage with the community and let us know what's going on. Can we expect new features soon? Is the game in development hell? Have they seen my fanart? These are all questions that we'd never get answered from uncommunicative developers - and that's something that we at Shoot Your Friends never want to be.

Before you start sending us fanart, you might want to know what this project is all about. Shoot Your Friends is a local multiplayer video game where you... shoot your friends. It's intended to be a couch game, something dear to the development team, with a fast gameplay loop and satisfying visuals. It's the perfect sort of thing for parties, if your parties are groups of 2-4 people who like shooting each other.

So check out this space for weekly updates on what we're working on. It's still really early in the development cycle, in fact probably too early to have anything exciting to share with you. But we've never done this before and want to get in the habit early. Plus we find the work we're doing interesting, so maybe somebody will nerd out with us.
